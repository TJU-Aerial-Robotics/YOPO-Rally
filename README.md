## Imitation Learning

### Cost Map Generation
The terrain is exported as the point cloud map, and is then processed by TTA (Terrain Type Analysis) to generate the cost map.

### Data Acquisition
The depth image, position, and orientation of the vehicle are recorded in the simulator.

### Trajectory Optimization
Cone constraints are applied to each primitive anchor to confine the trajectory within the neural networkâ€™s output range.

## Inference
The planner inputs depth image, velocity, goal vector, and outputs the candidate trajectories with the corresponding cost.
